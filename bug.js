This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test your React Native application.  The application might crash or exhibit unexpected behavior, with no clear error message in the console. This is often due to a mismatch between the Expo SDK version in your project and the version supported by the Expo Go app you are using. Another possibility is an incompatibility between your project's dependencies and the Expo Go environment.
