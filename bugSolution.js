Ensure your project's Expo SDK version is compatible with your Expo Go app. Update both to the latest versions if necessary.  Carefully review your package.json file to identify any conflicting dependencies that might cause issues within the Expo Go environment.  Consider using Expo's dependency management features for better compatibility.  If the problem persists, try creating a new Expo project and gradually transferring your code to isolate the problematic component.
